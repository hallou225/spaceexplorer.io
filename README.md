Milestone 1:
Vsc was used along with live server being installed to set up the start of the project,
a small tutorial was followed to print hello world into console for working test and use.
space game files were created a head of time for future use.

Milestone 2:
home page was worked on and functioned with small details but beginning of project was started.

Milestone 3:
home page was functional with working button that led to the character selection page,
then there code did stop but allowed for buttons and shapes that were for future image place holders.
deleted old space game files and created new ones based on each page for example home page was "HomePage.html"
and had a button that called to "characterselection.html" that was the set design for how the app would navigate through
the pages on computer.

Milestone 4:
milestone 4 is where the project took off, Home Page and character selection got a whole new remodeled look compared to milestone 3,
rest of the pages all followed same looks and format for easy naviagtion and neatness. App was intended for little kids, so app displays easy
button movements, along with little text for the user to not read as much. The interaction which is the tapping but for our purpose we did this on
a computer so the clicking(tapping) is our interaction to the computer for the user. The interaction of the tapping was coded throughout the game.
Mainly the game to dodge the meteorite allows for full tapping interaction, rest of app allows for tapping for buttons and navigate throughout the app.
character selection was given a remodel to be more user friendly and easier to select a character to play with, along with the game page being easy to play the 
game and allow for user interaction in a clean way. Then added information pages after the user beats the game so they can learn about the planet path they chose.
For example one path is Mars, so after dodging the meteorite they get to mars and there they learn facts about it, and then can explore a new path. 
As for the code, only 2 paths were made which are Mars, and Saturn. This was to complete the base of our app to be able to see full function, more time would allow for
other planets to be added.
