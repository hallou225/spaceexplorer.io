when user loses all lives then they get sent to a new page called game over
game over page says some info and allows for user to retry which sends them back to path selection page
updated the progress bar so it loads smoother and not chunky like before
also added a star which allows for user to collect and it increases the progress bar faster
then worked on mars and saturn pages to display a win page and information for user to learn and explore these 2 planets
when user finished the progress bar in the game page, depending on chosen path they get taken to that planet they chose

remodeled the path selection to do the same as well as show begin button before starting the adventure

small details and fixes, like controller bar for the character selection page to keep buttons in place
